#comments:
#Setting the IP address of network interface eth0 to 11.0.0.4 with a
#subnet mask indicated in the notation /24 (255.255.255.0).

#Adding a default "gateway" to the client's routing table,
#indicating that packets destined for an IP outside of the public
#network 1 should be routed through network interface eth0 and sent to the gateway with IP: 11.0.0.5.
